## Assignment details
- For each question, I have created a seaparte QuestionX.java class. (X = 1 to 5)

- For Question 1 - 4, I have created a generic ListNode.java class.
    Question 5 uses Node.java class.
    Both the classes have been included.

- The time complexity for all the solutions I have written is O(n)

## How to run the code

Run QuestionX.java class. These classes includes the main method. 
Input values are already provided in the main method.
