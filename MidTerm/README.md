3. In a Binary search tree print values which are inside of range. Optimize it if possible
4. Sorted insert in a Link list.
5. Write a function where I pass an sorted integer array  and another array of integers and the function returns me start indexes of those values in second array

## How to run the code

- For every questions I have create separate packages QuestionX.
- Run main.java class in the packages.
