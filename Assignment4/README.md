## Assignment details
- For each question, I have created a separate QuestionX.java class. (X = 1 to 8). 
### Except
Question 5. For Question 5 I have created, BSTIterator.java class. (Due to leetcode requirements)

## How to run the code

- Below questions does not include main method (Due to leetcode limitations of method signature)
Question 4, Question 5 (BSTIterator.java), Question 6.
- Rest of the questions have main method.
